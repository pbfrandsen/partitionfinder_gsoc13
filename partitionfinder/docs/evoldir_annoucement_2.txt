Dear all,

We're pleased to announce the release of PartitionFinder v1.1.0. 
This version contains a number of major improvements over previous
versions, not least that it can now analyse genome-scale datasets.

PartitionFinder is a program that allows for the combined selection
of partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution for DNA
and amino acid datasets. 

It is available here:

Version 1.1.0 includes a number of improvements:

    * Support for very large datasets (1000s of genes, 1000s of taxa)
    * New, faster, algorithms for finding partitioning schemes
    * Support for rapid model selection using RAxML
    * Hugely improved memory efficiency
    * Output of the best partitioning scheme in RAxML format
    * A number of bug fixes and other minor improvements
    
A full description of all the methods can be found in the manual.

Please get in touch if you have questions, suggestions, or comments.

Yours,

Rob Lanfear
