<p>We are two days into the coding period. Things have progressed smoothly so far. I have a working function for retrieving a Phylip file, running it through PhyML, parsing the site likelihoods, and running them through k-means clustering to split them into two.</p>

<p>The tricky part of today's code was dealing with Python's file object. If there are no rate categories included in the analysis, the output starts on a different line than if rate categories are estimated. Because of this, my parser needed to be robust to both types of files. I found that you cannot use readline() and next() one after the other. However, I needed to read the contents of the second line in order to discover which type of input the file was. I wanted to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>with open(str(new_file)) as new_file:
    new_file.next()
    line2 = new_file.readline()
    # Check to see which file it is
    if line2[0] == "P":
        # Move to line 7
    else:
        # Move to line 4
</code></pre>

<p>After consulting the fine folks at StackOverflow, I discovered that you can set a variable equal to newfile.next() and it will read in a string of the line it is leaving. My code then looked similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>line2 = new_file.next()
if line2[0] == "P":
    for _ in xrange(4):
        new_file.next()
else:
    new_file.next()
</code></pre>

<p>Very nice.</p>
